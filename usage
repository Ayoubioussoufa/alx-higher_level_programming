Terminal Communication Program

This program allows you to communicate between two terminal windows by sending messages from one terminal to another.

Usage:
./program_name <other_terminal_reference>

Parameters:
1. program_name: The name of the program executable.
2. other_terminal_reference: The reference to the other terminal's device file.

Example:
./program_name /dev/tty1

This example command will open communication with the terminal device /dev/tty1. You should replace "/dev/tt
y1" with the appropriate reference to the other terminal you want to communicate with.

Once the program is running, you can start typing messages. Press Enter to send each message to the other terminal.

Note:
- Make sure to run this program in one terminal and provide the reference to the other terminal as the command-line argument.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the specified terminal device.
- To terminate the program, you can press Ctrl+C or close the terminal window.
